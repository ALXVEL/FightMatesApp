# FightMatesApp

Most of the code can be found within the home.py and events.py

home.py -> handles layouts, main gui components, and reacts to user input
events.py -> this is the main webscraping script where it gets all the upcoming fights
client.py/server.py -> this works with sockets library, allows users to share predictions/messages amongst one another
.kv files -> GUI
